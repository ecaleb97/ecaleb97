## Hi there, I'm Caleb ðŸ‘‹

**`Developer/Traveller`**

I'm an indie full-stack developer. And here, I share I've been working on recently and things I learned along the way.
Besides software, another of my passions are maths, reading and traveller. I love teaching and learning new things
every day.
